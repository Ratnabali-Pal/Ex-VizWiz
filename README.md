### Abstract
To increase the diversity of the VizWiz dataset, the Extended VizWiz dataset has been introduced. This extension involves selecting a subset of images from the original VizWiz collection that are suitable for text-based question answering, where answers can be extracted directly from the image content. A total of 600 such images were identified, each supplemented with 1 to 5 additional question-answer pairs, enriching the dataset with text-centric visual questions.
